Dr. Hofstad's breakthrough uses quantum entanglement to connect D-latch circuits with electronically conductive crystals. that when a conductive crystal is physically broken, its physical properties may change, but its composition remains the same. This means that the crystal retains its electrical conductivity even after being separated.
